# Hangman-Game
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The player has to guess a randomly chosen word, one letter at a time, while avoiding incorrect guesses that reduce their available lives.

# How It Works
A random word is selected from a predefined list.
The player is given a limited number of lives (6 by default).
The player guesses letters, and correct guesses reveal parts of the word.
Incorrect guesses reduce the number of lives.
The game continues until the player either:
Guesses all the letters correctly (wins).
Runs out of lives (loses).

# Features
Words are chosen randomly from a list.
Ensures valid word selection (no spaces or hyphens).
Tracks used letters to prevent duplicate guesses.
Provides a visual representation of the word with dashes for missing letters.
Displays the number of remaining lives after each guess.
